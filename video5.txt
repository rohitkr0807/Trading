We will learn three strategies.

1. Moving average strategies (Only applicable for v40 companies).
We will use simple moving average strategies.
In this we will use three strategies - 200 days, 50 days and 20 days moving average strategies.
We will use 200days - Black
50days - Red color
20days - Green color.
We will use daily candle stick chart.
There is no stop loss in this category.
This strategies will be used in V40 Companies.

Buying will happen when the black color is on top means moving average of 200 days is on top.
Order will be Black on Top, Red in Middle and Green at bottom, and last will be closing price.

Selling will happen in just opposite way.
Order will be Black at bottom, Red in Middle and Green at top, and top will be closing price.
